A 'DUMMY' NODE SO AS TO FACILITATE THE USE OF THAT LINKED LIST AS A STREAM LATER
 AND ETC. WE CREATED TWO AUXILIARY FUNCTIONS, ONE TO HANDLE SIMPLES AND THE OTHER

CASE INPUTS MAY CAUSE UNDEFINED BEHAVIOUR IN THE PROGRAM. AS FOR PRINTING ERROR
CERTAIN TYPE IS READ (I.E. |, &, ;, OR (), APPROPRIATE ACTION IS TAKEN BASED ON
COMBINED APPROPRIATELY UNTIL THERE IS ONLY ONE LEFT WHICH IS THEN RETURNED.
COMMAND IS CONSTRUCTED OR THE STREAM HAS REACHED ITS END. THIS FUNCTION DRAWS 
COMMANDS ARE USED TO STORE THEIR RESPECTIVE COMMANDS AS THE COMMAND_STREAM IS 
COMMAND_STREAM LINKED LIST WITH FIELDS CHAR BUFFER(TO HOLD A WORD IF ANY) AND
COMMAND TYPE. THIS FUNCTION RELIES ON STATE TRANSITIONS. EVERY TIME A CHAR OF A
COMPLETE TOKEN IS MADE, AT WHICH TIME IT INSERT SAID TOKEN INTO THE END OF A
 EXECUTE_COMMANDS:
 EXECUTING THE RIGHT, BASED ON WHAT STATUS THE LEFT RETURNS. SUBSHELLS ARE EVEN

MAKE_COMMAND_STREAM:
MESSAGES, THE FUNCTION FPRINTF CAUSES SOME VERY STRANGE ERRORS WITH OUR PROGRAM

OUR IMPLEMENTATION ONLY COVERS MOSTLY STANDARD CASES THAT MAY OCCUR. ANY CORNER
READ_COMMAND_STREAM:
READING IN FROM THE STREAM A FULL COMMAND, ELEMENTS REMAINING IN THE STACK ARE 
READ. WHILE READING, IF THE CURRENT OPERATOR HAS LOWER EQUAL PRECEDENCE THAN THE 
 SIMPLER, ALL THATS NECCESSARY IS A RECURSIVE CALL TO EXECUTE_COMMANDS. SIMPLES 
 SIMPLER THAN PART A. HOWEVER, DESPITE OUR SUCCESSES, IT STILL MAY BE THE CASE

 THAT FOR CERTAIN STRANGE INPUTS, THE PROGRAM WILL PERFORM UNDEFINED BEHAVIOR.
 THE ENTIRE TREE IS CONSUMED. FOR EACH COMMAND, THIS FUNCTION CHECKS THE TYPE OF
